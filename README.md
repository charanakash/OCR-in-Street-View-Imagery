# OCR-in-Street-View-Imagery

## Situation:

- Accurate house number detection in street-level imagery is imperative for applications such as map construction and location-based services.
- The existing optical character recognition (OCR) methods fail to handle complex real-world images due to inconsistent fonts, lighting, etc.
- The SVHN data set, containing house number images extracted from Google Street View, is challenging for learning robust OCR models.

## Task:

- Develop a high-performance model that can correctly classify single digits in images from the SVHN dataset.
- Overcome the challenges posed by real-world factors such as varying lighting, image quality, and the presence of distractors.
- Evaluate the performance of the model and compare it with existing approaches.

## Action:

- Explored and evaluated various deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image classification.
- Implemented data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization, such as image rotation, translation, and noise injection.
- Trained and fine-tuned the chosen model on the SVHN dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for maximum accuracy.
- Thoroughly evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Analyzed the model's strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas for potential improvement.

## Result:

- Developed a high-performing model for single-digit recognition on the challenging SVHN dataset.
- Obtained 95 percent accuracy, meaning the model does indeed work fine for the realities of image complexity.
- Generated understanding about some of the real-world OCR difficulties and about how techniques based on deep learning could do so well on the particular task.
- Enabled advancement for the OCR technology, providing possible applications of OCR in more or less every field.
